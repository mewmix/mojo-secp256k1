"""Sub-package for base-10^9 big integer type."""

# About the module name `bigint`:
# According to PEP-8, Modules should have short, all-lowercase names.
# Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
# Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use
# of underscores is discouraged.
# Becuase the readability of `bigint` is already good, I use `bigint` instead of
# `big_int` for this sub-package and the module.
